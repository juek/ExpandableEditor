# Expandable Editor Admin UI plugin for Typesetter CMS - Archived #

## Obsolete as of Typesetter 5.2 ##

The functionality of this plugin was [implemented](https://github.com/Typesetter/Typesetter/commit/30229ab22d0c9a4a15241afb19bbaf3395eb88ac) in Typesetter 5.1.1-b1 and is from now on part of the core system of Typesetter 5.2+. For this reason, it is no longer being developed. Users of Typesetter 5.0 and 5.1 (including Beta 5.1.1-b1 until February 28, 2020) can continue to install and use it. When upgrading to Typesetter 5.2, it **must be uninstalled**.


## About ##

This tiny Admin UI plugin makes the editor sidebar expandable, which improves management of deep nested section structures and allows to show more buttons in the &lsquo;New Sections&rsquo; editor area without scrolling. 
* After installation watch out for the new [+] icon in the &lsquo;Editor Tabs&rsquo; area at the right top of the screen. 
* The expanded / collapsed state will be stored and maintained (individually for each user).
