# Expandable Editor Admin UI plugin for Typesetter CMS #

## About ##

This tiny Admin UI plugin makes the editor sidebar expandable, which improves management of deep nested section structures and allows to show more buttons in the &lsquo;New Sections&rsquo; editor area without scrolling. 
* After installation watch out for the new [+] icon in the &lsquo;Editor Tabs&rsquo; area at the right top of the screen. 
* The expanded / collapsed state will be stored and maintained (individually for each user).
